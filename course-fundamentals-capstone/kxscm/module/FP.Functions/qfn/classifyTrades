// @param tab {table} A a table that has columns  price, side, bid and ask
// @returns {table} The provided table with a with a new column called exQuality indicating 
// trade performance - good (1b) is within or better than market, bad (0b) is outside of market
{[tab]
    //Pseudocode: 
    //Performing an update will keep the original table 
    //When classifying, need to first check the side
    //If side is Buy, then a good trade was bought for less than what the market was asking for
    //If side is Sell, then a good trade sold for more than what the market was bidding for
    //The vector conditional might prove useful
